            <h1>Shame on us</h1>
            <h2>website and webapp<br>designs for a feminist cause</h2>
            <p>The more we spend time on the internet the more we can see the cruelty in people’s comments on articles regarding violence against women and I believe that most of it is because of the freedom of speech that the internet provides us along with the patriarchal conduct we still have on society.<br>This interactive Web Design class demanded that we’d engage in a cause, so I designed my website to be an environment in which women can share and comfort each other, focusing on those of us who rarely have the chance to be supported in the environment they live in.</p>

            <div id="projecttext"><p>My final layout of the website was composed by a home page with the main sections of the website, organized through expandable blocks. The first part would be dedicated to the shared stories, the second would contain important articles on the subject and at the bottom there would be a gallery with videos and short films regarding feminism and related stories. </p></div>

            <div id="projecttext"><p>The app was mainly designed with the website as a reference, but as it was developed it contributed with some necessary transformations on both structures. This project is supposed to be really simple and with easy navigation. Just like the website, the first pages would allow us to both choose our regions and log into the page/app. The main page would be the one with the stories, expandable as the user would scroll it down. As for the menu, it would open with the upper right icon to build up the other options, like the articles page, that would also function with the scroll and would expand as the user touches on an article of choice. </p></div>
